Since the From header field is populated by the originating UA it may not necessarly contain the actual identity. It usually is established by means of authentication between the originating UA and its outgoing proxy. The outgoing proxy then adds a P-Asserted-Identity header field to assert the identity of the originator to other proxies.<br><br>This header field has only meaning within what is called a trusted network by mutual aggreement on the requirements for its use by the parties involved.<br><br>The P-Asserted-Identity header field is defined in RFC 3325.
